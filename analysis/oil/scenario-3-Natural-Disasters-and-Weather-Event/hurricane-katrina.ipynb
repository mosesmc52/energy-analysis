    "Hurricane Katrina, one of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history, struck the Gulf Coast in late **August 2005**, making landfall on **August 29, 2005**. The storm reached **Category 5** strength at its peak, though it made landfall as a **Category 3** hurricane. It primarily affected the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, with New Orleans suffering catastrophic flooding due to levee failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hurricane caused widespread devastation, particularly in New Orleans, where levees broke, flooding over 80% of the city. Over **1,800 people** died, and hundreds of thousands were displaced. Economic damage was estimated at **$125 billion**, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of oil markets, Katrina disrupted a significant portion of U.S. domestic oil production and refining capacity, as the Gulf of Mexico is a major hub for the industry. About **95% of oil production** and **10% of refining capacity** in the region were shut down. This led to a short-term oil supply shock, causing prices to spike globally and highlighting the vulnerability of the U.S. energy infrastructure to natural disasters."
