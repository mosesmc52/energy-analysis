    "Top 3 producers of Oil\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Saudi Arabia:** As the largest exporter of crude oil and a leading member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia significantly influences global oil prices through its production levels and pricing strategies. The country often adjusts its production to stabilize or alter oil prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **United States:** The U.S. has become one of the largest oil producers in recent years, thanks to advancements in shale oil extraction. The country's production levels, along with its significant oil consumption and strategic reserves, play a crucial role in determining global oil prices. The U.S. also influences prices through its energy policies and export capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Russia:** As one of the top producers and exporters of oil, Russia's output levels and compliance with OPEC agreements significantly impact global oil markets. Its geopolitical actions and energy partnerships, particularly with OPEC, can lead to fluctuations in oil prices."
